# Image Enhancement Project - Documentation

## 1. Overview
This project focuses on enhancing images using local storage and processing. Users can upload images, apply enhancements (like sharpening, noise reduction, or AI-based upscaling), and download the improved versions. Additional features include batch processing, drag-and-drop uploads, and image format conversion.

## 2. Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (UI)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL (for metadata)
- **Processing**: OpenCV, Pillow (image enhancements)
- **Storage**: Local storage (uploads/ & enhanced_images/)

## 3. Core Features
✅ **Image Upload** – Users upload images from the UI.  
✅ **Batch Processing** – Users can upload and process multiple images at once.  
✅ **Drag & Drop Upload** – Enhanced UI with drag-and-drop functionality.  
✅ **Image Processing** – Apply enhancements using OpenCV/Pillow.  
✅ **Image Format Conversion** – Convert images to different formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP).  
✅ **Local Storage** – Store original & enhanced images in respective folders.  
✅ **Metadata Management** – Store file details in the database.  
✅ **Download Enhanced Images** – Users can view and download processed images.  

## 4. Workflow
1. User uploads one or more images (drag & drop or file selection).  
2. Images are stored in `uploads/`.  
3. Backend processes the images based on selected enhancements and formats.  
4. Enhanced images are saved in `enhanced_images/`.  
5. Frontend displays the processed images with download options.  

## 5. Frontend Features
- **Drag & Drop Upload** – Allows users to easily upload images.
- **Progress Indicator** – Shows upload and processing progress.
- **Batch Processing UI** – Displays multiple images for processing.
- **Format Selection** – Dropdown to select output format before processing.
- **Download Button** – Users can download enhanced images directly.

## 6. Future Enhancements
- **AI-based Auto Enhancement** – Use deep learning models for better quality.
- **Cloud Storage Support** – Integrate with AWS S3 or Firebase.
- **User Authentication** – Secure access to uploaded images.

## 7. Conclusion
This project provides a robust image enhancement solution with batch processing, drag-and-drop uploads, and format conversion. Future improvements can further optimize user experience and scalability.
